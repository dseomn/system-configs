  # Required, must be unique. Segment ID. This is used for multiple things:
  #
  #   * Private IPv4 subnets: C in 10.B.C.0/24
  #   * ULA IPv6 subnets: ZZ in fdXX:XXXX:XXXX:YYZZ::/64
  #   * Public IPv6 subnets: YY in XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXYY::/64
  #   * VLAN IDs
  #
  # Because it's used in VLAN IDs, 0 is not allowed, and 1 should probably be
  # avoided since it's often the default VLAN ID. Because of how it's used in IP
  # addresses, the maximum value is 255.
